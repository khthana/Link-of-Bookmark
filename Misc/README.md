My Rules of Success: 
• Passion is King 
• Without passion, you will never success
• You need to love what you do, if not, don't go further
• Doing your job as a hobby, you'll never get tired 
• But passion alone is not enough, you need effort
• Failure is the pathway, learn and move forward
• Try & fail, get up & try, using most of your time trying
• Don't let time just pass by, you'll surely be regret
• Money comes after all of these
