Authenticity
The project challenges students to create products for real world purposes & audiences.
Students (and teachers) need to be clear about the product, purpose and audience in a project and this is closely linked to authenticity.


Autonomy
he project provides opportunities for student voice & choice in the process & product.
teachers are increasingly releasing “control” and becoming more of a facilitator.
This autonomy can show up in a number of ways including allowing for increased student inquiry and choice over what to investigate, how to uncover the necessary learning as well as the ways in which they will show they know and understand.


Meaningful Assessment
The project guides teaching & learning using purposeful formative and summative assessments.
Using assessment as a tool to inform next steps and needed areas of improvement can be exciting, especially when the work is authentic, meaningful and purposeful.


Craftsmanship
The project provides opportunities & reason for students to create craftsman-like products.
